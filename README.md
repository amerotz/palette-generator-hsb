# palette-generator-hsb
Simple 5 color palette generator based on HSB color space.

The leftmost color is the starting color. To edit that, press "E" and you'll toggle editing mode (you'll see "EDITING" under HSB values). Then press 1-2 to decrease/increase brightness, 4-5 for saturation, 7-8 for hue (built to use with numpad).

When NOT in editing mode you'll be able to change "shiting" for each paramater. That means, how much colors shift in hue, saturation, brightness (a percentage between 0 and 1). Use same commands as above, making sure editing mode isn't on.

You can't save palettes (yet) and workflow isn't the best, but it does what it's supposed to do.
